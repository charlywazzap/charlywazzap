- before anything, the monster will focus on one specific character to attack
- The character will be the one it can perform an attack with the least amount of movement
- If the character is already adjacent, it will not move
- If more than 1 character are at the same range of movement, the focus is the one earlier in the [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.mech.round.ordering-initiative]]
- If no valid hexes to move, the monster will not act
