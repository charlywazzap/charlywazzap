## Description

The road back has been long, and now, to get attacked by Vermlings when all you want is a warm meal and a soft
bed. Well, it makes you mad. Mad enough to kill these mangle creatures before you collapse from exhaustion.
Of course, the Vermlings have other plans. they gibber about wanting your coin and the meat on your bones.
Nasty things. Best to ignore their ranting an end this now

## Goal

Kill all [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.ene.vermling-raiders]] (4)

## Interesting things that happened

- the mercenary group takes the initiative and strikes the front vermling and immobilizing it.
- hatchet gives the killing blow to the immobilized vermling
- The elite Vermling runs towards hatchet and swings his sword at  him striking him
- Hatchet returns the strike with  a barrage of axes hitting the leg of the elite  
  and a nearby vermling allowing him to run back to safety
- Voidwarden takes advantage of the hurt vermling and casts Turn out the light range attack killing it
- Hatchet lunges towards the vermling stunned by the dead corps of the elite decapitating him with one blow
- the single Vermling remaining ran screaming at the mercenaries but he wasn't even allowed to get near before
  Voidwarden and hatchet strike him dead while running

## Conclusion

You wipe the blood of the last Vermling from your face and your thoughts return to the
[[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.loc.sleeping-lion]]. Surely they got a stew ready by now. It would be perfect, warm and
soothing, and it's right through that gate. You are so close, you can already taste itâ€¦ But then, another thought comes.
Is highly unusual for a pack of vermlings to operate this close to the city . Could they be behind the
string of disappearances? It's a long shot but one worth investigating, considering this ambush site doesn't
look like their base of operations. there is probably a nest nearby that, with any luck, will have more information on
the [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.quest.missing-blacksmith]]. And treasure would be nice

## Rewards

Discovered [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.loc.hole-in-the-wall]]
