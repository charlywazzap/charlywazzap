Place a 3 damage token on top of each trap, When any figure enters a hex containing a trap, the trap is sprung
and removed from the map, and the figure suffers the 3 damage token

Traps are not obstacles.

## Monsters

- they consider the traps as obstacles and will avoid them unless its the only way to get to their focus target
