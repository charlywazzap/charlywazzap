Doors are hexes with blue borders

Doors separate rooms

Only monsters in the room the characters start in are setup at the beginning of the scenario.

To open the door a character can move into the hex as a normal movement and open it, an activation token is placed on the door
to indicate it was opened and all the monsters in the new room are setup 

This is call [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.mech.room-reveal]]

Doors are considered a wall until opened.
