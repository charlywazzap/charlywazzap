Attacks to multiple hexes it has 2 icons

- Gray hex indicate the hex the active figure currently occupy
- Red hex indicates where enemies can be located to be affected ( cannot target allies)
  - if no gray hex then its only required to have 1 red hex with in the range of the ability.


If multiple enemies are attacked you need to draw attack modifiers for each
