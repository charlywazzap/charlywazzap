## Description

After [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.playthru-1.scenario-1]] and [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.ene.vermling-raiders]], The tracks are easy to spot.
Vermlings have never been known for their subtlety. You follow the scratching indicators of a body being dragged until you find yourself approaching the walls of [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.loc.gloomhaven]]. 
The sun is very low, but something isnt right. that isnt just a shadow cast across a lower section of the wall, its a hole. The [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.ene.vermling-raiders]] have made a nest for themselves by burrowing into the wall itself. how industrious.

You crouch low and try to sneak closer but they must have guards watching the entrance. There is a shrill shrieking, and then, a number of [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.ene.vermling-raiders]] jump from the dark, brandishing their dull, poorly made weapons.

No choice now but to defend yourself. Lucky, you've ,managed to get your second win, but will definetly need a nice, long bath after the ordeal
 
## Objective

Kill all [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.ene.vermling-raiders]] and loot the place
## Interesting things that happened

- hatchet pushed started the fight by pushing a one of the two vermling right to a trap, hurting him badly and finishing the job with a double range attack killing one and huring the other
- Voidwarden followed up the attack and killed the second vermling
- The elite vermling was suppried with the attack that he stud stunned
- Hatchet stormed quickly with the aid of Voidwarden powering up his slash atack quickly enabling him to dispatch the elite vermling
- The mercenary group kicked the door open to find 2 more vermlings holding the fort behind traps
- Hatchet decided that this needed to end quickly, running over one of the traps hurting his leg
- Voidwarden run behind and provided a bit of healing
- One of the void lings threw his knife at him but only managed to scrape him.
- With both vermlings with hin reach Hatchet delivered the final blow to both with a double attack
- with all dead, the team collected all the loot available 

## Conclusion

With the Foul nest cleansed of those creatures, you take your time searching every nook, Surely, the city guard will want to know about this
it cant be safe to have Vermlings tunneling through the walls, its hard enough to fend off their raids as it is.
Eventually, you do manage to find an unexpectedly large amount of gold under some rotten wooden boards.
Sifting through the treasure, you also find a note in the Crude scartching. It details some business arrangement between th evermlings and someone named Roland[[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.npc.roland]]!
Apparently, in exchange for supplying fresh corpses, Roland would pay the Vermlings in gold. And judging by the amount here, the vermlings managed to kill quite a few people, before you put and end to it.

It's the best lead you have, so its time to ferret out this Roland character. After resting at the [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.loc.sleeping-lion]]
