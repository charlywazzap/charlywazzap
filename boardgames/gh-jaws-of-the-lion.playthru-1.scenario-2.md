## Description

After [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.playthru-1.scenario-1]] and [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.ene.vermling-raiders]], The tracks are easy to spot.
Vermlings have never been known for their subtlety. You follow the scratching indicators of a body being dragged until you find yourself approaching the walls of [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.loc.gloomhaven]]. 
The sun is very low, but something isnt right. that isnt just a shadow cast across a lower section of the wall, its a hole. The [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.ene.vermling-raiders]] have made a nest for themselves by burrowing into the wall itself. how industrious.

You crouch low and try to sneak closer but they must have guards watching the entrance. There is a shrill shrieking, and then, a number of [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.ene.vermling-raiders]] jump from the dark, brandishing their dull, poorly made weapons.

No choice now but to defend yourself. Lucky, you've ,managed to get your second win, but will definetly need a nice, long bath after the ordeal
