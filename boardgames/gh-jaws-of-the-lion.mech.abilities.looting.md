Characters have 2 ways of looting money

- At the end of a character's turn, that character auto loots their current hex tile
- Some cards contain a "loot X" ability which allows a figure to loot their current hex and all hexes within range X of
  them so "Loot 1" will allow a character to loot the standing hex and all adjacent hexes
