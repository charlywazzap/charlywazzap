Money tokens are collected by [[gh-jaws-of-the-lion.mech.abilities.looting]] and when a character collects a money token
place that in the character mat, where it will be recorded at the end of the scenario.

Money tokens are also placed at the same hex tile any time a monster dies.

Any money left on the map at the end of the scenario is uncollected
