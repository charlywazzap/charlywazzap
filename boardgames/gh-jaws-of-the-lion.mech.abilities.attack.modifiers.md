Anytime an attacker performs an attack the figure must flip over one card from their attack modifier deck

Types

- Numerical Value modifier (+ or - ) must be substracted or added to the attack value
- a 2x means the attack is doubled
- a / means no damage
- the 2x and the / also have a shuffle symbol if its revealed then the full deck should be reshuffled
